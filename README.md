3D Game Engine / Space Flight Simulator Demo
==========

So I wrote most of a Space Flight Simulator in high school.

OpenGL Game Engine.  Most of this code was written while I was still in high school - now that I'm done with college I'm going to probably revisit a bunch of it.

If you're interested in forking this, be sure to talk to me first as it's _very experimental_
